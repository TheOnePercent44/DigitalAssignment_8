<h2>Fear/Aggression Behavior Simulation</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You toy indirectly with the 3 blocks, setting the level of their fear of each other and their personal aggression towards others to alter their behavior.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Observation and Deliberation
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Simulation
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Click on the Green boxes to pause the game and edit the values (using the number keys). Set a value of 0-9 for each (they begin randomized) to alter the behavior of the blocks.

Warning: They seem to tend towards the upper left corner in the current build. If they get stuck there, refresh the page and begin anew.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Limited Indirect control over the actors.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Blocks
Indirect control!
ESCAPE THE MAP AT HIGH SPEED (Not a guaranteed part of the game)
More Blocks!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
No setting
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
See Setting/Premise
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
No determinate playtime
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
N/a
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
Needs a lot of work on the actual mechanics. At present they are hardly refined and highly prone to bugs.
</li>

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
Anthony Sermania: Lead Everything
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Blue, Yellow and Green blocks made with Gimp and assembled in Tiled as necessary (just the green ones really, the rest were used as sprites)
Also little red and purple balls from OpenGameArt
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Thomas was alone; inspiration for the art of all future prototypes from me. Seriously, play it. Cool game.
