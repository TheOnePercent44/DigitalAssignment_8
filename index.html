<h2>RANDO: The Psychically Enhanced PTSD Experiment</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You're an ex-soldier undergoing experimental treatment for PTSD which has accidentally unlocked wild and uncontrollable psychic powers (as well as your traumatic visions) and are now teleporting randomly around the office hunting all the enemy soldiers fleeing from your might!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Roleplay, Timing, Luck
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
I really don't know on this one. Depends on where development goes with it I guess.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use WASD or Arrow Keys to shoot. You will teleport every few seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
No movement control- limiting player's sense of control and causing them to need to be wary and wise. I guess this is a bit of a psychological prototype XD
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Blocks
Shoot all the "bad" guys!
TELEPORTING!
More Blocks!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A med la-*cough* I mean snowy forest full of kindly doct-*er, rather, evil enemy soldiers.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
See Setting/Premise
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 minutes depending on approach
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Be patient, you're not timed. Make your shots count.
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
Depending on how much more detail one would want in the mechanics, anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks more to put together something servicable.
</li>

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
Anthony Sermania: Lead Everything
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Blue, Yellow and Green blocks made with Gimp and assembled in Tiled as necessary (just the green ones really, the rest were used as sprites)
Also little red and purple balls from OpenGameArt
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Thomas was alone; inspiration for the art of all future prototypes from me. Seriously, play it. Cool game.
</li>
